At the time, I was considering developing some form of application which would allow people to share code in real time, whilst discussing it. I thought this would be effective for teaching code, or working on projects in teams. I decided to create this using Swing.","The application is in two parts; both client and server have a GUI, the intent being that multiple clients can connect to a server, which has certain management options such as password-locking or port-switching, as well as logging access.","This was some of my earliest work with Java, and I made an effort to use good practices such as Abstraction (through using interfaces) and an MVC pattern for the GUIs","The project makes use of RSyntaxTextArea, a library which adds syntax highlighting of many programming languages to Swing."],"name":"JavaPad","projectRepo":"http://www.github.com/Csloan7597/JavaPad","shortDescription":"A project created using the Java Swing GUI library, and java's networking capabilities. This was created during my studies, with the aim of providing a way for multiple users to code together, using a 'turn-based' approach to editing syntax-highlighted code","smallImage":"/images/projects/javapad-small.png","tagLine":"Collaborative Coding","techUsed":"Java, Swing, SSL, Maven, Sockets, HTML, Threading"}

When deciding which tools to use, I wanted to stay away from 'Out of the box' solutions such as wordpress, as I saw an opportunity to get some website building experience. Eventually, I chose Spring MVC, a technology I would soon be using at Amazon.","The site is built using JSP for the front end, broken up into partials using Apache Tiles. The design of the site itself is basic, but I made sure to follow proper patterns and practices in the back end java code, such as using Data Access Objects for access to relational data, in this case, stored in a MySQL server DB."],"name":"Portfolio Site v1","projectRepo":"http://www.github.com/Csloan7597/PortfolioSite","shortDescription":"My first portfolio website, this project was created using Spring MVC, MySQL, and Apache Tiles, in order to learn those technologies, as well as establish a presence on the Web.

My topic, and one of my own personal interests, was the Open Source Cloud platform Openstack.","The idea behind this project was to shed light on OpenStack's functionality, use cases, and performance, especially with respect to its competitors and the industry's history. One interesting question I had to answer was, 'Does OpenStack really live up to the hype?'.","My approach to this problem was to perform Quantitative & Qualitative evaluation. I started with background research into the IaaS/PaaS space, and compiled & analysed information on OpenStack and it's competitors. I then gave a full technical evaluation of OpenStack's architecture and components, and configured my own instance on a School testbed cluster.","Using the installed OpenStack fleet, I wrote a Java test harness using Spring, which would run experiments on any given fleet using the OpenStack REST APIs. The results of my re-usable experiments were provided and analysed in the report.","For this project, I attained a score of 85, one of the highest in my School, and a 1st class award. It also served as part of the initial research for the EU funded project, ASCETiC (ascetic.eu)."],"name":"An Evaluation of OpenStack","projectRepo":"https://github.com/Csloan7597/FinalYearProject","shortDescription":"A three month technical evaluation of the popular Open Source Cloud platform OpenStack, carried out as part of my University studies, and on behalf of the EU project ASCETiC.
