{"content":["I was born in a small town called Wallasey, just over the river mersey from Liverpool. This is where I grew up, although as a child I travelled with my father who was in the army, and lived in Surrey & Germany. My interest in Computers & Technology really developed in my early teenage years, from making a nuisance of myself on the School Computers, to eventually getting one of my own and starting to experiment.","I started programming relatively late, at the age of 17 during my A level studies, but as soon as I started I knew it was something I could spend my life doing; I have a natural 'engineer' mindset, and I take a lot of pleasure from finding and solving real life problems. "," I attended Calday Grange Grammar School, where I obtained 12 GCSEs and 4 A levels, and then moved onto the University of Leeds, where I studied for a BSc in Computer Science. In 2014 I graduated with First Class Honours, winning an Academic Prize for my final year performance. ","During my studies, I worked for two prestigious technology companies; Oracle & British Telecom. During these placements I gained valuable experience as a person and as a professional Software Engineer. After graduating, I joined Amazon as a Software Development Engineer, where I enjoyed a period of great enjoyment and growth in my Career. Eventually, I left to join Apple's iCloud engineering org. I am currently working to increase my breadth of knowledge of new and upcoming technologies, having been lucky enough to work with tech such as Virtualisation, Big Data, and large scale Web Services in the first few years of my Career. I am extremely excited about the future of technology, and this gives me tremendous levels of motivation!"],"images":["/images/about/about1.png", "/images/about/about2.png", "/images/about/about3.png"]}
